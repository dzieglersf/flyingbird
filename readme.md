# Flying Birds

Flying Birds is just a little JavaScript animation that Gus Cost and I put together one Sunday afternoon.

This project uses [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) and [Raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com).

## Quick start

Clone the git repo - `git clone git://github.com/dzieglersf/flyingbird.git` - or [download it](https://github.com/dzieglersf/flyingbird)


## Features

* A pretty scene is drawn.
* Birds fly through the sky.
* If you click one, it will plunge to earth and die.
* Pseudo-gravity governs a dead bird's freefall.
